## üöÄ Overview
This app acts as both a live Draft Assistant and a fully automated Mock Draft simulator. It ingests your custom tiered rankings (including K & DST in late tiers), applies strategic heuristics plus LLM reasoning (Google Gemini or OpenAI GPT), and produces fast, explainable picks. A tuned fast-mode algorithm + late-round roster logic guarantees you leave your draft with a structurally sound roster.

## ‚úÖ Key Features
| Category | Highlights |
|----------|------------|
| AI Integration | Toggle between **Google Gemini** and **OpenAI GPT** at setup |
| Strategy Engine | Two-step flow: (1) Strategy generation ‚Üí (2) Specific player recommendation |
| Fast Mock Mode | 8‚Äì10√ó faster simulation using deterministic tier + positional need scoring + lightweight prompts (or no prompts) |
| Late-Round Intelligence | Enforces completion of: QB, RB, RB, WR, WR, TE, Flex (RB/WR), DST, K within 16 picks |
| K & DST Handling | Explicit deprioritization until roster size ‚â• 12 or must-fill phase; guarantees both are drafted late (K ~ Tier 16, DST ~ Tier 17) |
| Essential Roster Tracking | Live status pills show filled vs pending core slots & remaining essential needs |
| Player Blocking | Instantly remove players from future AI consideration & mocks |
| Tier-Based Rankings | Your uploaded JSON defines the board; lower tier number = higher value |
| API Key In-App Entry | No env vars required; keys never stored server-side |
| Visual Feedback | Animated fast-mode pick flow, highlighting, pulsing phases |
| Simulation Harness | Script to repeatedly test pick timing & validate late K/DST logic |

---

## üß† How It Works
1. You upload a JSON ranking list with tiers (including Kickers in Tier 16 & Defenses in Tier 17).
2. In Assistant Mode:
   - You request a strategy ‚Üí AI summarizes optimal directional approach (value pocket, structural need, tier cliffs).
   - You confirm ‚Üí AI recommends a single player that fits strategy + roster context.
3. In Mock Mode:
   - Opposition picks are either AI-selected (normal) or algorithmic (fast mode).
   - The fast algorithm scores players by: base tier + positional priority + unmet essential bonuses.
   - K/DST suppressed until late; forced if essential slots equal remaining picks.
4. Status pills update live: essential needs, roster progress, remaining obligatory slots.

---

## üì¶ Player Rankings JSON Format
Upload a single JSON array. Each object must contain:
`rank`, `name`, `team`, `position`, `tier`.

Valid positions: `QB`, `RB`, `WR`, `TE`, `K`, `DST`.

Kickers should reside in **Tier 16** and Defenses in **Tier 17** (as per current late-round heuristics). Example (truncated):

```json
[
  { "rank": 1, "name": "Justin Jefferson", "team": "MIN", "position": "WR", "tier": 1 },
  { "rank": 7, "name": "Bijan Robinson", "team": "ATL", "position": "RB", "tier": 1 },
  { "rank": 28, "name": "Mark Andrews", "team": "BAL", "position": "TE", "tier": 3 },
  { "rank": 150, "name": "Top Kicker 1", "team": "KC", "position": "K", "tier": 16 },
  { "rank": 165, "name": "Elite Defense 1", "team": "NYJ", "position": "DST", "tier": 17 }
]
```

Minimum validation rules:
* Non-empty array
* All required keys present
* Positions must be from the supported list
* Tiers numeric, ascending meaning higher value when lower

## üî• Run on Web
Tackle4Loss Fantasy Draft is available at *[https.tackleforloss01.web.app]*

## üñ•Ô∏è Run Locally
Prerequisite: Node.js (LTS 18+ recommended).

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open the printed URL (default: http://localhost:5173).

Setup Screen Steps:
1. Choose Draft Mode (Assistant or Mock)
2. (Optional) Enable Fast Mode for mocks
3. Select AI provider (Gemini / OpenAI)
4. Paste API key for chosen provider
5. Configure league size, pick slot, format (Snake / Linear)
6. Upload rankings JSON
7. Start Draft

---

## üîê API Keys & Privacy
* Keys are entered client-side and used only for outbound API calls.
* No persistence beyond session.
* You may rotate keys anytime via provider dashboards.

Providers:
* Gemini: https://ai.google.dev/  
   *You can create a Gemini API key for FREE in **Google AI Studio**: https://aistudio.google.com/*
* OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

## üß™ Simulation / Validation (Fast Mode)
We include a harness to statistically confirm late K/DST behavior:

```
npm install # (if not already)
npx ts-node --esm scripts/simulateFastMock.ts
```
Outputs average roster slot when your tracked team drafts K & DST and flags early selections. Adjust tier distribution or heuristics in `fastMockService.ts` if needed.

---

## ü§ñ Core Roster Enforcement
The system guarantees these slots within 16 picks:

```
QB, RB, RB, WR, WR, TE, (Flex RB/WR), DST, K
```
Dynamic logic:
* Tracks essential unmet needs each pick
* If remaining picks == remaining essential slots ‚Üí forced essential selection
* K/DST only scored positively once roster size ‚â• 12 unless forced
* Final two slots: guaranteed fill if still missing

---

## ‚ö° Fast Mode Algorithm (Summary)
Score = TierScore ‚àí (PositionPriority * weight) ‚àí EssentialBonus
* PositionPriority escalates early RB/WR depth, safeguards early QB/TE, suppresses K/DST
* EssentialBonus accelerates filling missing core slots
* Forced branch triggers if must-fill scenario detected

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Deploy
Production build:
```
npm run build
```
Output directory: `dist`

Deploying on Render (Static Site):
* Build Command: `npm run build`
* Publish Directory: `dist`
* No server env vars required (keys entered in-app)

### Firebase Hosting
1. Install CLI (global optional): `npm i -g firebase-tools`
2. Authenticate: `npx firebase login`
3. Set your project id in `.firebaserc` (`YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`)
4. Deploy:
```
npm run deploy
```
Hosting config lives in `firebase.json` (long-cache static assets, no-cache HTML).

## üêû Troubleshooting
| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| AI returns player not on board | Ensure JSON names exactly match; refresh & re-upload |
| K/DST picked too early | Verify tiers (K=16, DST=17) & rerun simulation harness |
| No strategy modal appears | Check console for API key / quota errors |
| Simulation script import error | Use `npx ts-node --esm scripts/simulateFastMock.ts` |

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (Ideas)
* Custom roster templates (2QB / Superflex)
* Bye week balancing signals
* Value over replacement (VOR) integration
* Export draft recap & strategy rationale
* Multi-board comparison (consensus vs custom tiers)

Happy drafting & may the tiers be ever in your favor.
